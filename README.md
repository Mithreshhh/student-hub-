# Smart Student Hub

Unified platform for managing student activities, faculty approvals, analytics, and shareable portfolios. A Next.js frontend talks to a Node.js/Express API backed by PostgreSQL. Each student gets a built-in, read-only activity sheet that can be shared with recruiters without any external spreadsheet service.

## Features

- Role-based dashboards for students, faculty, admins, super admins, and recruiters
- Activity submission with certificate and image uploads, plus a faculty approval workflow
- Auto-generated, shareable student activity sheets (`/sheet/[shareToken]`)
- Public portfolios, analytics, and job postings with applications
- JWT authentication, CSV reports, and scheduled report emails over SMTP

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, Tailwind CSS 4, Chart.js, Framer Motion, GSAP
- Backend: Node.js 20+, Express 5, PostgreSQL (`pg`), JWT, Multer, Nodemailer

## Local Development

Requires Node.js 20+ and PostgreSQL 14+.

1. Create a database:

   ```bash
   createdb smart_student_hub
   ```

2. Start the API:

   ```bash
   cd smart-student-hub/backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env    # fill in DB credentials and JWT_SECRET
   npm run dev             # http://localhost:5000, health at /health
   ```

   Tables, default activity categories, and the default super admin are created automatically on startup.

3. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd smart-student-hub
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env.local
   npm run dev             # http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`smart-student-hub/backend/.env`)

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_ENV` | prod | Set to `production` when deployed |
| `PORT` | no | Defaults to `5000` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | prod* | Postgres connection string. Takes precedence over `DB_*` |
| `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` | prod* | Used when `DATABASE_URL` is not set |
| `DB_SSL` | no | `true`/`false`. Defaults to on in production |
| `DB_POOL_MAX` | no | Pool size, defaults to `20` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | yes | 32+ random characters in production |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` | no | Defaults to `7d` |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | prod | Public frontend URL. Used in share links and as the default CORS origin |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | no | Comma-separated list of allowed browser origins, overrides `FRONTEND_URL` for CORS |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE` | no | Upload limit in bytes, defaults to 10 MB |
| `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `SMTP_FROM` | no | Needed only for scheduled report emails |
| `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | no | Used once by `npm run create:super-admin` |

\* Provide either `DATABASE_URL` or the full set of `DB_*` variables.

Generate a JWT secret with:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"
```

### Frontend (`smart-student-hub/.env.local`)

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | Base URL of the API, no trailing slash. Baked in at build time |

## Production Deployment

### Database

Use a managed PostgreSQL instance (Neon, Supabase, Render, Railway, RDS) and copy its connection string into `DATABASE_URL`. SSL is enabled automatically when `NODE_ENV=production`.

### Backend API

Deploy `smart-student-hub/backend` to any Node host (Render, Railway, Fly.io, a VM with PM2).

- Build command: `npm ci --omit=dev`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Health check path: `/health` (returns `503` when the database is unreachable)
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`, `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `FRONTEND_URL`

With `NODE_ENV=production` the server:

- exits on startup if required variables are missing, `JWT_SECRET` is shorter than 32 characters, or the database is unreachable
- only accepts browser requests from `FRONTEND_URL` / `CORS_ORIGINS`
- sends security headers including HSTS and hides error details from responses
- shuts down gracefully on `SIGTERM`

## Default Super Admin

The API creates this account on first startup if it does not exist yet. Log in at `/login` and choose **Super Admin** as the account type.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Email | `superadmin@smarthub.edu` |
| Password | `SuperAdmin@123` |

The credentials are defined in `smart-student-hub/backend/config/database.js`. Changing the password after first login is recommended, since it is public in this repository. A changed password is kept across restarts.

All other accounts (admins, faculty, students, recruiters) are created from the app.

Uploaded resumes, certificates and activity images are stored in Azure Blob Storage (containers `resumes`, `certificates`, `activity-images`), and PostgreSQL stores each file's Blob URL. Set `AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME` in `backend/.env`. The API authenticates with `DefaultAzureCredential` (`az login` locally, Managed Identity in Azure), and that identity needs the Storage Blob Data Contributor role on the account.

On a VM, run the API under PM2 behind nginx with HTTPS:

```bash
npm ci --omit=dev
NODE_ENV=production pm2 start server.js --name smart-student-hub-api
pm2 save
```

### Frontend

Deploy `smart-student-hub` to Vercel (set the project root directory to `smart-student-hub`) or any Node host.

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to the deployed API URL before building

After both are live, set the API's `FRONTEND_URL` to the final frontend domain so CORS and share links match.
